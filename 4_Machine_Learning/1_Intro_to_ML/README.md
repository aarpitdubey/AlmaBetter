# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Data Science?

- Data Science is a **multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data**. It combines elements from computer science, statistics, mathematics, and domain expertise to analyze data and make predictions, classifications, and decisions.

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. **AI is a broader concept that encompasses various subfields, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP).**

- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

- Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to perform complex tasks such as image and speech recognition.

- Business Knowledge refers to an understanding of business operations, strategy, and industry trends. It includes knowledge of markets, customers, competition, and regulatory environment. In data science, having a strong understanding of the business problem and domain expertise is critical for developing effective solutions.

## Role of Data science

- The role of data science is to extract insights and knowledge from data and to provide decision-makers with actionable information. Data scientists use a combination of technical and business skills to work with stakeholders, gather and process data, build and validate models, and communicate findings and recommendations.

## Why it is important to Understand Data science?

- Data science is important because it enables organizations to make informed decisions based on data, and to turn data into competitive advantage. Data science applications can be found in many industries, such as healthcare, finance, retail, and transportation, to name a few. For example, in healthcare, data science can be used to develop predictive models to help diagnose diseases and to personalize treatments. In finance, data science can be used to detect fraudulent transactions and to predict stock prices. In retail, data science can be used to analyze customer behavior and to optimize pricing and inventory management.

# Machine Learning

- Learning is any process by which a system improves performance from experience.

- Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improves their perfoemance through past experiences.


Heuristics and machine learning are two distinct approaches to solving problems and making decisions.

Heuristics are simple, intuitive strategies that are based on prior experience and knowledge, and are used to quickly find good solutions to problems, even though they may not always be the best. Heuristics are often used when an exact solution is not possible or when a fast solution is more important than an optimal one.

Machine learning, on the other hand, is a data-driven approach that uses algorithms and statistical models to automatically improve the performance of a system by learning from data. Machine learning algorithms can be used for tasks such as classification, prediction, and clustering, and are typically used when a large amount of data is available.

In summary, heuristics are used for quick and efficient problem solving, while machine learning is used for data-driven problem solving and decision making.
